Requires: 
sudo gem install twitter
sudo gem install rb-appscript

Configuration:
Copy the supplied sample.twitter file to your home directory and rename to ".twitter".
Modify the file to change the text "your_Twitter_username" to your actual twitter username.
If you wish newly created tasks to be assigned a context, add a value to the right of the "new_task_context: " text. The value does not need to start with the '@' sign, but it will not be automatically added if it is included.
Make the importTwitterFavsToReminders.sh file executable, by running 
"chmod 755 importTwitterFavsToReminders.sh" in a terminal window with the current directory 
the same as where the script lives.

Running:
Run the importTwitterFavsToReminders.sh script

Purpose:

Script to add all twitter favourites for a user into the default list in the Reminders app now available under OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion.
This script is configured through a .twitter file, which should exist in the users 
home directory. A sample.twitter file is provided to show the basic file format. 
This file will be updated by this script to keep a handle on the newest tweet which 
a task was created for. The element "lastProcessedTweet" will be added to keep track of
the id of the last tweet processed, to prevent processing the same tweet multiple times.

The created task will have a title in the form:
"Tweet from <user display name> <link to tweet>"
and a note in the form:
"<tweet text>"
The reminder will have no due date. This functionality may be added later.
