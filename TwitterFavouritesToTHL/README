Requires: 
sudo gem install twitter
sudo gem install rb-appscript

Configuration:
Copy the supplied sample.twitter file to your home directory and rename to ".twitter".
Modify the file to change the text "your_Twitter_username" to your actual twitter username.
Make the importTwitterFavsToTHL.sh file executable, by running 
"chmod 755 importTwitterFavsToTHL.sh" in a terminal window with the current directory 
the same as where the script lives.

Running:
Run the importTwitterFavsToTHL.sh script

Purpose:

Script to add all twitter favourites for a user into the inbox list in The Hit List.
This script is configured through a .twitter file, which should exist in the users 
home directory. A sample.twitter file is provided to show the basic file format. 
This file will be updated by this script to keep a handle on the newest tweet which 
a task was created for. The element "lastProcessedTweet" will be added to keep track of
the id of the last tweet processed, to prevent processing the same tweet multiple times.

The created task will have a title in the form:
"Tweet from <user display name>"
and a note in the form:
"<tweet text>

<link to tweet>"
The start date for the task is date the task was run. Originally (and still commented out), the creation date of the tweet was used instead.
