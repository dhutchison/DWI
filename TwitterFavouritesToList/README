Requires: 
sudo gem install twitter
sudo gem install rb-appscript

Configuration:
Copy the supplied sample.twitter file to your home directory and rename to ".twitter".
Modify the file to change the values for the settings to the correct values. Unfortunately this script now requires each user to get their own twitter API keys from http://dev.twitter.com/apps/new. This is due to changes in twitter's API, which have been reflected in the latest version of the twitter gem that this script depends on.

If you wish newly created tasks to be assigned a context, add a value to the right of the "new_task_context: " text. The value does not need to start with the '@' sign, but it will not be automatically added if it is included.
Make the importTwitterFavsToList.sh file executable, by running 
"chmod 755 importTwitterFavsToList.sh" in a terminal window with the current directory 
the same as where the script lives.

Running:
Run the importTwitterFavsToList.sh script

Purpose:

Script to add all twitter favourites for a user into a TODO list application. 
The application used in based on the configuration file. 

This script is configured through a .twitter file, which should exist in the users 
home directory. A sample.twitter file is provided to show the basic file format. 

The "import_application" element has two possible values, which changes the application that 
the import will be performed to:
  * "THL" will use The Hit List, with items inserted into the Inbox.
  * "Reminders" will use the Reminders app under OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion, with items inserted into the default list.

This file will be updated by this script to keep a handle on the newest tweet which 
a task was created for. The element "lastProcessedTweet" will be added to keep track of
the id of the last tweet processed, to prevent processing the same tweet multiple times.

The created task will have a title in the form:
"Tweet from <user display name> <link to tweet>"
and a note in the form:
"<tweet text>"
The reminder will have no due date. This functionality may be added later.
